To prevent data type errors, carefully choose the appropriate data type for each column based on the expected range and nature of the data. Use a larger integer type if you anticipate needing to store larger numbers. To avoid problems with JOINs, carefully consider which type of JOIN (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER) is most appropriate for your query.  To handle NULL values, use functions like ISNULL or COALESCE to provide default values or to handle them appropriately in aggregate functions. To prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities, use parameterized queries or prepared statements. Avoid directly concatenating user input into SQL queries.  Here is an example of a parameterized query:

```sql
PREPARE stmt FROM 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?';
SET @username = 'user_input';
EXECUTE stmt USING @username;
DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;```
